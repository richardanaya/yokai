# Yokai Roguelike Development Plan

## Core Concept
A roguelike game featuring Japanese yokai (supernatural creatures), using Unicode characters for visualization and incorporating complex environmental systems that affect gameplay.

## Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic game engine setup
- Terminal rendering using Unicode characters (kanji/kana where appropriate)
- Basic player movement and collision
- Simple map generation

## Phase 2: Environmental Systems
- Time system (day/night cycle)
- Moon phases system
  - New Moon
  - Waxing Crescent
  - First Quarter
  - Waxing Gibbous
  - Full Moon
  - Waning Gibbous
  - Last Quarter
  - Waning Crescent
- Seasonal system
  - Spring (桜/花見)
  - Summer (夏祭り)
  - Autumn (紅葉)
  - Winter (雪景色)
- Weather conditions
  - Clear (晴れ)
  - Rain (雨)
  - Snow (雪)
  - Fog (霧)
  - Storm (嵐)

## Phase 3: Yokai Implementation
- Basic yokai types:
  - Kappa (河童) - water-dwelling creature
  - Tengu (天狗) - mountain spirit
  - Kitsune (狐) - fox spirit
  - Oni (鬼) - demon
  - Yurei (幽霊) - ghost
- Yokai behaviors tied to environmental conditions
  - Different yokai active during different moon phases
  - Seasonal yokai appearances
  - Weather-specific behaviors

## Phase 4: Dynamic Visuals
- Color system based on:
  - Time of day (朝/昼/夕/夜)
  - Season
  - Weather
  - Moon phase
- Unicode character selection for:
  - Terrain features (山川草木)
  - Items (宝具)
  - Creatures (妖怪)
  - Effects (術法)

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Yokai interaction system
  - Combat
  - Dialog
  - Alliances
- Item system with Japanese mythological items
- Special abilities based on time/weather conditions
- Sound effects and background music matching environment

## Phase 6: Polish
- Balance gameplay
- Add story elements
- Implement save/load system
- Add tutorials and help system
- UI improvements and accessibility features

## Technical Considerations
- Unicode handling for proper character display
- Color mixing system for environmental effects
- Performance optimization for weather/time calculations
- Data structure for complex creature behaviors
